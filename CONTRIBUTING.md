## GitHub Access and Team Setup

We have completed the setup of GitHub access and team structures for the **IMAGO Project**.  
Each product team now has its own dedicated GitHub team, and all members have been assigned accordingly.

üîó **Teams Directory:** [IMAGO GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/Imago-SDRUK/teams)

---

## Team and Repository Structure
- Each **product team** has a corresponding **private repository**.  
- Teams are responsible for maintaining their own repositories.  
- When a repository is ready to be shared publicly, it will be made available for everyone.  

---

## Access Policy
- All organization members have access to both **public** and **private** repositories within the IMAGO Project.
---

## Offboarding Process
When a member leaves the **IMAGO Project**:
- Their membership will be converted to an **Outside Collaborator**.  
- They will retain access only to the **repositories (public or private)** they contributed to.  
- They will no longer be listed as a member of the organization.

---

## üêõ Reporting Issues

- **Search** existing issues before opening a new one.
- Use the **bug** or **feature request** templates.
- Provide a clear title, description, and steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Screenshots and error messages are helpful!

## üîÑ Resolving Merge Conflicts

Sometimes, your PR may have conflicts with the main branch. To resolve:

1. Fetch the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout my-feature-branch
   git merge main
   ```
2. Fix any conflicts in your files (look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers).
3. Add and commit the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```
4. Push your branch again:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```
